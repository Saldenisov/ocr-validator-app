# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## What you need to do:

1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `ocr-validator-app`
   - Description: `OCR Validator App with LaTeX support for scientific tables`
   - Keep it Public
   - DO NOT initialize with README (we already have everything)

2. **After creating the repository, run these commands:**

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ocr-validator-app.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative if you get authentication issues:

If you get authentication issues, you can:

1. Use GitHub Desktop application
2. Or use Personal Access Token:
   - Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with "repo" permissions
   - Use token as password when prompted

## After successful push:

Your repository will contain:
- ✅ All 3,551 images across 5 tables
- ✅ Complete Docker setup with LaTeX
- ✅ Download functionality for validation databases
- ✅ All deployment configurations

## Next steps:
1. Deploy on Railway.app or similar platform
2. Set environment variables: BASE_DIR=/app/data, PORT=8501
3. Share the live URL with colleagues
